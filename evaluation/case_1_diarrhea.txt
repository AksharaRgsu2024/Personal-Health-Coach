**POSSIBLE CONDITIONS** *(based on symptom cluster and medical knowledge)*

| Likely diagnosis | Why it fits | Key distinguishing features |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|

| **Traveler’s diarrhea / bacterial infection** | If recent travel or exposure to contaminated food/water. | Often watery stools, possible cramps, sometimes fever. |

**LIFESTYLE RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Hydration** – Sip clear fluids (water, oral rehydration solution, broth).
2. **Dietary adjustments** –
   - Avoid spicy, fatty, fried, and high‑fiber foods until symptoms improve.
   - Reintroduce bland foods (rice, bananas, toast, applesauce) gradually.
3. **Probiotics** – Consider a probiotic supplement or yogurt with live cultures to help restore gut flora.
4. **Hand hygiene** – Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially before meals and after bathroom use.
5. **Avoid alcohol and caffeine** – These can worsen diarrhea.
6. **Monitor stool** – Note color, consistency, presence of blood or mucus.

**POSSIBLE TREATMENTS**

| Option | When to use | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Oral rehydration solution (ORS)** | Every time you have a bowel movement or feel thirsty. | Prevents dehydration; follow package instructions. |
| **Over‑the‑counter antidiarrheal (e.g., loperamide)** | If diarrhea is frequent (>3 times/day) and not accompanied by fever or blood. | Do **not** use if you suspect bacterial infection with fever or bloody stools. |
| **Antibiotics** | Only if a bacterial infection is confirmed (e.g., positive stool culture) or if symptoms persist >3 days with fever. | Requires prescription. |
| **Prescription medications** | For IBS (e.g., antispasmodics, low‑dose tricyclic antidepressants) if symptoms recur chronically. | Not indicated for acute episode. |
| **Medical evaluation** | If you develop: fever >38 °C, blood/mucus in stool, severe abdominal pain, signs of dehydration (dry mouth, dizziness, decreased urine). | Seek urgent care or ER. |
